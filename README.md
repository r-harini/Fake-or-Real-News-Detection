# Fake-or-Real-News-Detection

## With the upcoming presidential elections, several rumours are spread on social media which may induce panic amongst the citizens and sway their beliefs.

## Therefore this project aims at classifying news as True or Fake with the help of dataset from Kaggle. 

## I have compared several ML models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Support Vector machine with the help of Natural language processing techniques such as POS tagging, vectorization and Unigram, bigram and trigram analysis.

## Further, I have also implemented a neural networks with Bidirectional LSTM layers along with GloVe embeddings to improve the classification and extract the meanings and weights behind each word. I have also tried to improve the training time with the help of distributed training on Tensorflow GPU.

## The neural network shows the highest accuracy (99.8 %) amongst all the models implemented.
